# Core System Services - Always Enabled
# These are fundamental services that should be enabled on ALL machines
# regardless of backup state. They are required for basic system functionality.
#
# Format: service_name|description
#
# Note: Services like systemd-resolved are NOT included because:
# - They're conditionally needed (NetworkManager provides DNS on desktop)
# - They're already handled per-machine in HARDWARE_MAPPING.conf
# - systemd-timesyncd is less critical than NTP daemon if using NetworkManager
#
# This list is intentionally minimal - only truly universal critical services.
# Most services should be in HARDWARE_MAPPING.conf for per-machine control.
#

# Seat management (required for display server)
seatd.service|Seat management daemon (required for Wayland/X11)

# Core system functions
acpid.service|ACPI event daemon (required for power button, etc.)
